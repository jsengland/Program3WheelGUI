Program #3 README
Jason England, 4/2/20

1. Program status (what works, what doesn't)
Everything on this program works to my knowledge. I have tested it extensively.


2. Do you have quality code? 
/* See our coding guidelines, Javadoc, chunks, etc */
I definitely do have quality code. I made sure indenting was proper and I have a lot of white space and comments.



3. How to run your program
Compile all java files then run Main.



4. Creative element
I decided to add a background to the window of the wheel gui. I hope you enjoy it! :)



5. Other notes
I decided to use your "MyList.java" and "MyNode.java" for a few reasons.
1. My code directly lines up with ur linkedlist so there may be less problems to run the program on ur machine.
2. My code from program1 was very sloppy and I did not want to introduce that messiness into my program 3 (I'm a changed programmer).
3. My code from program1 had some errors and kinks that would waste too much time trying to fix.
Hopefully using your classes for my program3 is ok. I made sure to leave your name and everything on it so it does not come off as me trying to steal your code.
Thanks! :)
